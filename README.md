# ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;Hi there
I'm constantly motivated by technology, and as a child, I used to wonder how the Internet operated. Because of those things, I was able to study web programming, and I now like working with websites on both the front end and back end. When it comes to web creation and research, I am also a highly committed and enthusiastic worker.
